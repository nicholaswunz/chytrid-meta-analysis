## Abstract
1. The development of infectious disease depends on the intensity of pathogen infection. However, the sensitivity of a host’s phenotype or functional trait related to the fitness such as behaviour, physiology, and reproduction may differ to infection load. Establishing commonalities in trait sensitivity to pathogen infection across species can provide insight to the pathogenesis of emerging infectious diseases.
2. Here, I systematically conducted a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis to test how infection intensity affects different functional traits (e.g., behaviour, physiology, morphology, reproduction) and the survival in amphibians infected with a globally impacting cutaneous fungal pathogen, *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (*Bd*).
3. There was a strong effect of Bd infection on traits related to energy metabolism and xxx, and the effect was more pronounced for species classified as ‘susceptible’. On average, ‘resistant’ and ‘tolerant’ species did not show considerable changes in functional response to infection intensity compared to susceptible species. Variation in mortality was better predicted by life stage than resistance type, with a higher probability of mortality for juveniles at lower pathogen load. Importantly, there were strong biases for studies on immune response, body condition, and survival, while traits such as locomotor capacity, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular traits were lacking.
4. This study suggests quantifying pathogen load can predict functional disruption for susceptible species and can help inform management strategies on pathogen thresholds before the onset of irreversible damage and mortality. Hence, infection intensity can predict function disruption, but measurement bias currently limits generalised implications.
