## Abstract
1. The development of infectious disease depends on the intensity of pathogen infection. However, the sensitivity of a host’s phenotype or functional trait related to the fitness such as behaviour, physiology, and reproduction may differ to infection intensity. Determining commonalities in trait sensitivity to pathogen infection across species can provide insight to the pathogenesis of emerging infectious diseases.  
2. Here, I systematically conducted a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis to test how infection intensity affects different functional traits (e.g., behaviour, physiology, morphology, reproduction) and the survival in amphibians infected with a globally impacting cutaneous fungal pathogen, *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (*Bd*).  
3. There was a strong effect of *Bd* infection on energy metabolism, and the overall effect was more pronounced for species classified as ‘susceptible’. On average, ‘resilient’ and ‘tolerant’ species did not show considerable changes in functional response to infection intensity compared to susceptible species. Mortality was better predicted by life stage than resistance type, where juvenile mortality showed a negative relationship between infection intensity and exposure duration, while adult mortality was depended on infection intensity only. Importantly, there were strong biases for studies on immune response, body condition, and survival, while traits such as locomotor capacity, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular traits were lacking.  
4. This study suggests quantifying pathogen load can predict functional disruption for susceptible species and may help inform pathogen thresholds before the onset of irreversible damage and mortality. Hence, infection intensity mediates functional disruption in amphibians, but study bias currently limits generalised implications.
